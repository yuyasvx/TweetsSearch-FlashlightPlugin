This is an auto-generated plugin skeleton. Edit the `examples.txt`, `info.json` and `plugin.py` files to turn it into the plugin you need.

For more info on how this works, see [the docs](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/wiki/Creating-a-Plugin).

If you're building a search plugin, you may want to base your code off [a search plugin](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/tree/master/PluginDirectories/1/googlesearch.bundle) instead.
